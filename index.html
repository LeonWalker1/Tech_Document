            <p>
                You possess a kind of inner force that seeks to guide you toward your Life’s Task
                —what you are meant to accomplish in the time that you have to live. In
                childhood this force was clear to you. It directed you toward activities and
                subjects that fit your natural inclinations, that sparked a curiosity that was deep
                and primal. In the intervening years, the force tends to fade in and out as you
                listen more to parents and peers, to the daily anxieties that wear away at you.
                This can be the source of your unhappiness—your lack of connection to who you
                are and what makes you unique. The first move toward mastery is always inward
                —learning who you really are and reconnecting with that innate force. Knowing
                it with clarity, you will find your way to the proper career path and everything
                else will fall into place. It is never too late to start this process.

            <h3>THE HIDDEN FORCE</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Toward the end of April 1519, after months of illness, the artist Leonardo da
                Vinci felt certain that his death was only a few days away. For the past two years
                Leonardo had been living in the château of Cloux in France, the personal guest
                of the French king, François I. The king had showered him with money and
                honors, considering him the living embodiment of the Italian Renaissance, which
                he had wanted to import to France. Leonardo had been most useful to the king,
                advising him on all kinds of important matters. But now, at the age of sixtyseven, his life was about to end and his thoughts turned toward other things. He
                made out his will, received the holy sacrament in church, and then returned to
                his bed, waiting for the end to come.

                    But the majority of men devote themselves to silencing that voice of the vocation and refusing
                    to hear it. They manage to make a noise within themselves…to distract their own attention in
                    order not to hear it; and they defraud themselves by substituting for their genuine selves a

                    life, without experiencing an inner calling? Whoever is born with a talent, or to a talent, must
                    surely find in that the most pleasing of occupations! Everything on this earth has its difficult
                    sides! Only some inner drive—pleasure, love—can help us overcome obstacles, prepare a
                    path, and lift us out of the narrow circle in which others tread out their anguished, miserable
                    existences!

            <p>
                It might seem that connecting to something as personal as your inclinations and
                Life’s Task would be relatively simple and natural, once you recognize their
                importance. But in fact it is the opposite. It requires a good deal of planning and
                strategizing to do it properly, since so many obstacles will present themselves.
                The following five strategies, illustrated by stories of Masters, are designed to
                deal with the main obstacles in your path over time—the voices of others
                infecting you, fighting over limited resources, choosing false paths, getting stuck
                in the past, and losing your way. Pay attention to all of them because you will
                almost inevitably encounter each one in some form.

                <li>Return to your origins—The primal inclination strategy</li>
                <br>
                <p><code>
                    For Masters, their inclination often presents itself to them with remarkable
                    clarity in childhood. Sometimes it comes in the form of a simple object that
                    triggers a deep response. When Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was five, his father
                    gave him a compass as a present. Instantly, the boy was transfixed by the needle,
                    which changed direction as he moved the compass about. The idea that there was
                    some kind of magnetic force that operated on this needle, invisible to the eyes,
                    touched him to the core. What if there were other forces in the world equally
                    invisible yet equally powerful—ones that were undiscovered or not understood?
                    For the rest of his life all of his interests and ideas would revolve around this
                    simple question of hidden forces and fields, and he would often think back to the
                    compass that had sparked the initial fascination.

                    As a child growing up in Madras, India, in the late 1950s, V. S.
                    Ramachandran knew he was different. He was not interested in sports or the
                    other usual pursuits of boys his age; he loved to read about science. In his
                    loneliness he would often wander along the beach, and soon he became
                    fascinated by the incredible variety of seashells that washed up on shore. He
                    began to collect them and study the subject in detail. It gave him a feeling of
                    power—here was a field he had all to himself; nobody in school could ever
                    know as much as he did about shells. Soon he was drawn to the strangest
                    varieties of seashells, such as the Xenophora, an organism that collects discarded
                    shells and uses them for camouflage. In a way, he was like the Xenophora—an
                    anomaly. In nature, these anomalies often serve a larger evolutionary purpose—
                    they can lead to the occupation of new ecological niches, offering a greater
                    chance of survival. Could Ramachandran say the same about his own
                    strangeness?

                    In 1760, at the age of four, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart took up the piano under
                    his father’s instruction. It was Wolfgang who asked to start lessons at this
                    precocious age; his sister, age seven, had already started on the instrument.
                    Perhaps it was partly out of sibling rivalry that he had taken such initiative,
                    seeing the attention and love that his sister received for her playing and wanting
                    it for himself.

                    From the time he was born in 1960, Freddie Roach was groomed to be a boxing
                    champion. His father had been a professional fighter himself, and his mother a
                    boxing judge. Freddie’s older brother began learning the sport at an early age,
                    and when Freddie was six he was promptly taken to the local gym in south
                    Boston to begin a rigorous apprenticeship in the sport. He trained with a coach
                    several hours a day, six days a week.

                    As a very young child Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983) knew that he
                    experienced the world differently than others. He was born with extreme
                    nearsightedness. Everything around him was a blur, and so his other senses
                    developed to compensate for this—particularly touch and smell. Even after he
                    was prescribed glasses at the age of five, he continued to perceive the world
                    around him with more than just his eyes. He had a tactile form of intelligence.
                    Fuller was an extremely resourceful child. He once invented a new kind of
                    oar to help propel him across the lakes in Maine where he spent his summers
                    delivering mail. Its design was modeled after the motion of jellyfish, which he
                    had observed and studied. He could envision the dynamics of their movement
                    with more than his eyes—he felt the movement. He reproduced this motion in
                    his newfangled oar and it functioned beautifully. During such summers he would
                    dream of other interesting inventions—these would be his life’s work, his
                    destiny.

                    After your formal education, you enter the most critical phase in your life—a
                    second, practical education known as The Apprenticeship. Every time you
                    change careers or acquire new skills, you reenter this phase of life. The dangers
                    are many. If you are not careful, you will succumb to insecurities, become
                    embroiled in emotional issues and conflicts that will dominate your thoughts;
                    you will develop fears and learning disabilities that you will carry with you
                    throughout your life. Before it is too late you must learn the lessons and follow
                    the path established by the greatest Masters, past and present—a kind of Ideal
                    Apprenticeship that transcends all fields. In the process you will master the
                    necessary skills, discipline your mind, and transform yourself into an
                    independent thinker, prepared for the creative challenges on the way to mastery.

                    Life is short, and your time for learning and creativity is limited. Without any
                    guidance, you can waste valuable years trying to gain knowledge and practice
                    from various sources. Instead, you must follow the example set by Masters
                    throughout the ages and find the proper mentor. The mentor-protégé relationship
                    is the most efficient and productive form of learning. The right mentors know
                    where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and
                    experience become yours. They provide immediate and realistic feedback on
                    your work, so you can improve more rapidly. Through an intense person-toperson interaction, you absorb a way of thinking that contains great power and
                    can be adapted to your individual spirit. Choose the mentor who best fits your
                    needs and connects to your Life’s Task. Once you have internalized their
                    knowledge, you must move on and never remain in their shadow. Your goal is
                    always to surpass your mentors in mastery and brilliance.

                    ften the greatest obstacle to our pursuit of mastery comes from the emotional
                    drain we experience in dealing with the resistance and manipulations of the
                    people around us. If we are not careful, our minds become absorbed in endless
                    political intrigues and battles. The principal problem we face in the social arena
                    is our naïve tendency to project onto people our emotional needs and desires of
                    the moment. We misread their intentions and react in ways that cause confusion
                    or conflict. Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic
                    light possible. By moving past our usual self-absorption, we can learn to focus
                    deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates
                    them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. Navigating smoothly
                    the social environment, we have more time and energy to focus on learning and
                    acquiring skills. Success attained without this intelligence is not true mastery,
                    and will not last.

                    As you accumulate more skills and internalize the rules that govern your field,
                    your mind will want to become more active, seeking to use this knowledge in
                    ways that are more suited to your inclinations. What will impede this natural
                    creative dynamic from flourishing is not a lack of talent, but your attitude.
                    Feeling anxious and insecure, you will tend to turn conservative with your
                    knowledge, preferring to fit into the group and sticking to the procedures you
                    have learned. Instead, you must force yourself in the opposite direction. As you
                    emerge from your apprenticeship, you must become increasingly bold. Instead of
                    feeling complacent about what you know, you must expand your knowledge to
                    related fields, giving your mind fuel to make new associations between different
                    ideas. You must experiment and look at problems from all possible angles. As
                    your thinking grows more fluid your mind will become increasingly dimensional,
                    seeing more and more aspects of reality. In the end, you will turn against the
                    very rules you have internalized, shaping and reforming them to suit your spirit.
                    Such originality will bring you to the heights of power.

                    All of us have access to a higher form of intelligence, one that can allow us to
                    see more of the world, to anticipate trends, to respond with speed and accuracy
                    to any circumstance. This intelligence is cultivated by deeply immersing
                    ourselves in a field of study and staying true to our inclinations, no matter how
                    unconventional our approach might seem to others. Through such intense
                    immersion over many years we come to internalize and gain an intuitive feel for
                    the complicated components of our field. When we fuse this intuitive feel with
                    rational processes, we expand our minds to the outer limits of our potential and
                    are able to see into the secret core of life itself. We then come to have powers
                    that approximate the instinctive force and speed of animals, but with the added
                    reach that our human consciousness brings us. This power is what our brains
                    were designed to attain, and we will be naturally led to this type of intelligence if
                    we follow our inclinations to their ultimate ends.
